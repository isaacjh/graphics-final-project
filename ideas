-- MAIN DESCRIPTION --
2.5 dimensional platformer, a la Smash Brothers. Hero moves from the left of the stage to the right.
Objective: Collectibles? Reach the end of the stage? Destroy enemies? Dunno lol
Environment: A back-alley kind of world, dimly lit. There are boxes and windows in the background --
the walls of houses are made of brick and the night sky is visible above them. Houses are individual
units and there can be "cracks" between them. Houses can have drainage pipes behind them, windows, 
be dusty... There could light coming from hanging lamps, or lamposts. The hanging lamps could swing
around back and forth. There could be a fly or two around each lamp.

The hero has the ability to run, jump, and... something. Shoot light out of his hands? Maybe throw
light bombs. Not necessarily anything to do with light, but it would be cool. Shadows would be cool, 
depending on how hard they are to implement. 

The whole premise of the game needs to settled, though... a megaman clone, maybe? With a flamethrower.
Or a vaccuum. Luigi's Mansion clone? 
Ooh ooh! Objective: light all the lamps. Yay!

Lamp: hanging street lamps that can kind of sway (maybe). They have a fly or two around them (particle
system? Not necessary... Just have like three and make them move in a sine course around the center).
They have a light in the center. How bad is this gonna be if we want to render more than 8 lights at 
once? It would also be cool if the light gave off random sparks every once in a while. This would be 
a particle system thing.
